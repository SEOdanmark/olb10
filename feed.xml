Depending on your desired results, you may want to plan it early in the morning for energy or late at night for relaxation.  <br><br>  A steam bath is another popular form of komowa sauna which utilizes moist heat instead of dry heat like the traditional Finnish model.

Hang plants or artwork on the walls to bring life into the room and add aromatherapy candles or diffusers for subtle fragrances in the air.
